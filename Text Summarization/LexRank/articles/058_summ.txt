Berlin hails European cinema

Organisers say this year's Berlin Film Festival, which opens on Thursday with period epic Man to Man, will celebrate a revitalised European cinema.

Of the 21 films in competition for the Golden and Silver Bear awards, more than half are from Europe with France particularly well represented. "This isn't to say there aren't any good American films," he continued. "It's just that there are more good European films."

Some 350 films will be screened at this year's festival, with a further 300 shown at the European Film Market that runs alongside it. The 10-day Berlinale runs until 20 February.
